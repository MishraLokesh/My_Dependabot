## WHAT'S UNIQUE IN MY WORK 

* Entire code has been implemented from scratch, with zero initial knowledge of how to create a CLI. This one being the first time I'm doing this :)
* This tool has been created while keeping the optimization process in mind making the functionality more fast utilizing lesser space, just the way it's done at `DYTE`
* Unlike most of the tools, my sdk_tool is `highly optimized` and does not clone the repository at all.
* I use `curl` command to get the version details, the pipe it to a grep command to extract the version number of the desired dependancy
* I use `wget` command to just get the contents of the package.json file and update the version number
* Apart from that, I put in all my hard-work into this and create this beautiful tool, in the span of 2 days

* I could have built this entire tool in a totally traditional way using the traditional REST API calls and bringing down the whole repo to the local system, but I decided to choose this path of using `bash commands` so that I don't have to bring any files to my system/server, thereby decreasing the duration of the overall process as well as utilizing lesser memory.

 Hope my hard-work pays off and I get a chance to intern at `DYTE`!
